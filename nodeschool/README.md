### My Solution to Nodeschool.io

When taking the module CS3281/82, each student is required to pick a technology and learn it well.

As a learning process to achieve technology expertise in Node.js, I planned to attempt several workshops provided on [NODESCHOOL.io](http://nodeschool.io/), and this repo contains my solutions.

In particular, I will focus on topics as followed:
* [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode): learn the basic of node.js, including using async I/O and creating simple server. (Done)
* [Promise It Won't Hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt): promise is an elegant way to make asynchronous computations (With ES6 Promise) (Done)
* [Count to 6](https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6): Learn how to use some features from ES6, the next version of JavaScript.
* [Tower of Babel](https://github.com/yosuke-furukawa/tower-of-babel): Show you through a series of exercises that introduce you to ES6 features.
* [perfschool](https://github.com/bevacqua/perfschool): Web performance optimization related.
