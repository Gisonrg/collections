### My Solution to Nodeschool.io

When taking the module CS3281/82, each student is required to pick a technology and learn it well.

As a learning process to achieve technology expertise in Node.js, I planned to attempt several workshops provided on [NODESCHOOL.io](http://nodeschool.io/), and this repo contains my solutions.

In particular, I will focus on topics as followed:
* [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode): learn the basic of node.js, including using async I/O and creating simple server.
* [Promise It Won't Hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt): promise is an elegant way to make asynchronous computations
* [Async You](https://github.com/bulkan/async-you): learn how to use async.js to solve the so called promise hell problem.
